Project # 2 - Abalone Sex Classification
This research utilizes the Abalone Dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, focusing on eight key physical features to train machine learning models for the multiclass classification task of predicting Abalone sex (male, female, or infant). This project uses the Pycaret Python library to benchmark and compare the performance of several machine learning models in this task. Additionally, the impacts on model performance through Feature Engineering & Hyperparameter tuning was studied. Finally, a Tensorflow Neural Network model is developed and performance is compared to the Pycaret solution. It was found that the Logistic Regression performed the best â€“ achieving an AUC of 0.77. It was further found that a combination of three one vs. all multiclass classification models (Female vs Not Female, Infant vs. Not Infant, Male vs. Not Male) improved other performance metrics and achieved an overall average accuracy of 72%, recall of 85.4%, precision of 75.4% and F1 of 81.3%. A Tensorflow Neural Network solution was also explored but found to underperform the Pycaret solution.
